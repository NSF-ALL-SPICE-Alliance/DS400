#### Regression Variables of Interest

-   `food_environment_index`

    -   The **Food Environment Index (FEI)** is a **County Health Rankings** composite (0–10 scale, where **10 = best**) that summarizes how easy it is for people in a county to get enough **healthy, affordable food**.

        It combines two pieces of information:

        1.  **Food insecurity** – the estimated share of residents who lack reliable access to enough food.

        2.  **Limited access to healthy foods** – the share of people who are **low-income and far from a grocery store** (typically ≥1 mile in urban areas or ≥10 miles in rural areas).

            These components are blended and rescaled to 0–10:

            **Higher FEI (closer to 10)** → lower food insecurity and better physical access to healthy food.

            **Lower FEI (closer to 0)** → more food insecurity and poorer access (more “food deserts”).

-   `percent_fair_or_poor_health`

    -   a County Health Rankings (CHR) indicator from the BRFSS survey:

        -   **What it is:** the **percentage of adults** who answer **“fair” or “poor”** to the question, “In general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?”

Literature-Informed Priors: Fair/Poor Health \~ Food Environment Index

Empirical Background

Several studies using BRFSS, County Health Rankings (CHR), or linked datasets find that better local food access is associated with lower rates of poor self-rated health.

| Parameter | Prior (percent scale) | What it encodes | Literature tie-in |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Intercept (β₀)** | `Normal(17, 4)` | At **average FEI**, a typical county has \~**17%** fair/poor health (95% prior ≈ **9–25%**) | BRFSS/CHR descriptive range (≈14–20% typical); compatible with Berkowitz (food insecurity ↔ higher % fair/poor) |
| **Slope (β₁)** | `Normal(-1.3, 0.6)` *(pp per +1 FEI)* | Each **+1 FEI** is expected to **reduce** fair/poor health by **\~1.3 percentage points** on average (95% prior ≈ **−2.5 to −0.1** pp) | **Fan & Jin (2022)** report −**1.3 pp** per +1 FEI; **Liese et al. (2014)** (odds ≈1.1× worse per unit) implies ≈ **−1 to −1.6 pp** per +1 FEI near 15–20% baseline |
| **Residual SD (σ)** | `Exponential(1/4.5)` | Mean residual scatter ≈ **4.5 percentage points** (allows substantial county heterogeneity) | County-level BRFSS/CHR models often show **4–6 pp** residual SD after single-predictor adjustment |

### Simulation with rstanarm

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

→ Each **+1** in **Food Environment Index** is associated with **\~2.6 percentage-point lower** fair/poor health, on average.

**Residual SD (sigma)** = **3.6 pp**: after accounting for FEI, counties typically vary by about ±3–4 percentage points around the line.
