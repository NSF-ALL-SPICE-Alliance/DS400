#### Reading in Data w/ [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html)

[![](images/clipboard-1031246121.png){width="78" height="89"}](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html)

There are multiple options to read data into R

1.  Data download (manual click) -\> Move into project "data" folder -\> read_csv() with here()
2.  Sometimes data is included in packages
    1.  In this case, the penguins data we are going to analyze is included in the palmerpenguins package.

##### Option 1

```{r, message=FALSE}
penguins_data_from_csv <- read_csv(here("data/penguins_lter.csv"))
```

##### Option 2

```{r, message=FALSE}
penguins_data_from_package <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
raw_penguins_data_from_package <- palmerpenguins::penguins_raw
```

##### 

Please note that all of these methods of reading data in to R are *reproducible* meaning that this script should work for anyone using the appropriate steps with Github

#### A Little Data Cleaning

Let's focus on the dataframe penguins_data_from_csv for learning purposes

-   If you click on the dataframe in you environment you'll notice the space in the column names, ex. Culmen Length (mm)

    -   Having spaces in column names often causes headaches, R doesn't like it, so we always avoid spaces

        -   We can do this with underscores (snakecase)

            -   culmen_length_mm

        -   We can do this with capitals (camelcase)

            -   CulmenLengthMm

Lets start by cleaning one column name manually, so you can appreciate the janitor packages' efficiency

First, with Base R

```{r}
names(penguins_data_from_csv)[names(penguins_data_from_csv) == "Culmen Length (mm)"] <- "culmen_length_mm"
```

Second, with the dplyr package

```{r}
penguins_data_from_csv <- penguins_data_from_csv %>% 
  rename(culmen_depth_mm = "Culmen Depth (mm)")
```

We are lucky our penguins dataframe only has 17 columns, but often times dataframes can have many more. So manually cleaning column names with base R or dplyr is highly inefficient. Here's where the janitor package, clean_names() function comes to the rescue!

```{r}
penguins_data_from_csv <- penguins_data_from_csv %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Awesome, now all of our column names are clean and our dataframe is ready for analysis

#### Exploratory Analysis

The skim() function from the skimr package gives us a cool overview of the data with one line of code

```{r}
skimr::skim(penguins_data_from_csv)
```

#### Exercise 2 {style="color: #B8860B;"}

What other packages/functions do a similar thing?

-   Try a good ol google search "R package to get in depth description of dataframe"

    -   How about a Chat GPT search?

-   Type you answer(s) in bullet points below

```{r}
introduce(penguins_data_from_csv)
```

```{r}
plot_intro(penguins_data_from_csv)
```

#### Data Visualization

Wohoo!! ggplot is the most common package used for data visualization in R!

Let's start with the most basic plot we can make

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Cool! What if we color the histogram by species

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Interesting! Seems like flipper length is very dependent on species of penguin

The magic of ggplot is simplicity and *customization* so let's customize

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha =0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Distribution of Flipper Length",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "number of penguins")
  
```

Manually exciting colors is cool, but there are also color palettes available for us with viridis

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha =0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Distribution of Flipper Length",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "number of penguins")
```

Let's investigate flipper length with another type of data viz

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Again, let's customize!

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.2) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Distribution of Flipper Length",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "",
       y = "flipper length (mm)") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
  

```

Awesome! Let's take a look at flipper length and it's relationship to body mass

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

Cool! Let's add species and island to this plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
   labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Flipper Length & Body Mass",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "body mass (g)")
  
```

#### Exercise 3 {style="color: #B8860B;"}

-   Part 1

    -   In the code chunk below create a histogram with culmen_depth_mm on the x axis and color by species using the dataframe *penguins_data_from_csv*. Give the plot the theme: theme_bw(). Assign a color palette with *scale_fill_viridis_d()*. Give the plot a title, subtitile and custom x and y axis titles.

```{r}

```

-   Part 2

    -   In the code chunk below create a scatterplot with culmen_depth_mm on the x axis, body_mass_g on the y axis, and color by species using the dataframe *penguins_data_from_csv*. Give the plot the theme: theme_bw(). Assign a color palette with *scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "inferno")*. Give the plot a title, subtitile and custom x and y axis titles.

```{r}

```

#### Interactive Data Visualization

```{r}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
   labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Flipper Length & Body Mass",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "body mass (g)")
```

```{r}
ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```

Question from Class

-   How can we edit the tooltip to replace body_mass_g with "body mass"

```{r}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, 
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = island, 
                           text = paste(
                             "Flipper Length (mm):", flipper_length_mm,
                             "<br>Body Mass (g):", body_mass_g,
                             "<br>Species:", species,
                             "<br>Island:", island))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Flipper Length & Body Mass",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "body mass (g)")

# Convert the ggplot object to a plotly object with customized tooltip
ggplotly(scatter_plot, tooltip = "text")



```

Awesome! Let's add one more variable to the plot, the sex of the penguin. Since we have already used our x axis, y axis, color, and shape for other variables, our best option is to use facet_wrap() to slit the plot into two plots based on sex

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_data_from_csv, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
   labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Flipper Length & Body Mass",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "body mass (g)")

```

Interesting, it seems there are actually 4 unique sexes in the dataframe (male, female, ".", and NA).

We could also have seen this with the unique() function

```{r}
unique(penguins_data_from_csv$sex)
```

-   If we wanted to know the number of penguins in each category for sex, we can use table(), however this does not include NA

    ```{r}
    table(penguins_data_from_csv$sex)
    ```

-   We can use the sum(is.na() function to count the number of penguins with NA as the sex

    -   This was also included in the skim() function in the beginning of this document

```{r}
sum(is.na(penguins_data_from_csv$sex))
```

Let;s filter for observations where sex is wither male or female and drop observations with na in the sex column

```{r}
penguins_male_female <- penguins_data_from_csv %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("MALE", "FEMALE")) %>% 
  drop_na(sex)
```

-   Notice in our environment pane that our \# of observations went from 344 in the dataframe penguins_data_from_csv to 333 observation in penguins_clean

Let's let's make the same faceted scatter plot from the new dataframe

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins_male_female, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
   labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Flipper Length & Body Mass",
       subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
       x = "flipper length (mm)",
       y = "body mass (g)")
```

#### Data manipulation

Our first plots did not call for us to manipulate the data at all. How about if we wanted to make a bar graph of the average body mass by species?

-   Let's create a new dataframe called *average_body_masses* that has the average body mass for each penguin species. We'll do this by using the *group_by()* and *summarise()* functions.

    ```{r}
    average_species_body_mass <- penguins_data_from_csv %>% 
      group_by(species) %>% 
      summarise(average_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
    ```

-   Sweet! Now let's plot the results

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = average_species_body_mass, aes(x = species, y = average_body_mass)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity")
    ```

-   Cool, but let's clean the graph up

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = average_species_body_mass, aes(x = species, y = average_body_mass, fill = species)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      theme_bw() +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
      scale_fill_viridis_d()
      
    ```

-   It might be nice to have the bars going horizontally. We can do this with cooed_flip()

    -   Let's also get rid of the legend since the species is already written on the axis and add appropriate titles

    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = average_species_body_mass, aes(x = species, y = average_body_mass, fill = species)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      theme_bw() +
      scale_fill_viridis_d() +
      coord_flip() +
      theme(legend.position = "none") +
      labs(title = "Palmer Penguins, Average Body Mass by Species",
           subtitle = "3 penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica",
           x = "average body mass (g)",
           y = "species")
      
    ```

#### Exercise 4 {style="color: #B8860B;"}

-   In the code chunk below create a new dataframe called *average_species_flipper_length* that has the average flipper length for each species

```{r}


```

-   In the code chunk below, plot *average_species_flipper_length* using *ggplot()* and geom_bar(). Customize the graph with colors, a theme, and labels

```{r}


```

#### Joining Data

Let's say the only way to get the penguins data was via the uri. At the top of this quarto document, we read in two datasets via uri, the *adelie_penguins_data_from_url and gentoo_penguins_data_from_url.* How can we join them together to analyze data for both species?

-   We can use the function full_join()

```{r}
gentoo_adelie_penguins_data_joined <- full_join(gentoo_penguins_data_from_uri, adelie_penguins_data_from_url)
```
