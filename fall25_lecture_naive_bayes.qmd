### Story

We’ll start our naive Bayes classification with just a single penguin. Suppose an Antarctic researcher comes across a penguin that weighs less than 4200g with a 195mm-long flipper and 50mm-long bill. Our goal is to help this researcher identify the species of this penguin, Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo.

#### Challenge - Let's Plot!

Take 10 minutes to make a visualization that will help the researcher determine the species based on the characteristics described above

```{r}
data(penguins_bayes)
penguins <- penguins_bayes %>%
  mutate(above_average_weight = if_else(above_average_weight == 1, "above_avereage_weight", "under_average_weight"))
```

#### Big picture 

-   Why use naive bayes classification instead of bayesian logistic regression

    -   3 classes/possible values in target variable (species)

-   What makes naive bayes "naive"

    -   It assumes quantitative predictors are normally distributed

    -   It assumes predictive features are not correlated with each other

#### One Categorical predictor 

-   Penguin is "below average weight"

P(B\|A)

-   P(Chinstrap \| below average weight)
-   P(Adelie \| below average weight)
-   P(Gentoo \| below average weight)

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(above_average_weight, species) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("row")
```

```{r}
probability_chinstrap_given_below_average_weight <- 0.65
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(above_average_weight, species) %>%
  group_by(above_average_weight) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = above_average_weight, y = percent, fill = species)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(percent, accuracy = 1)),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "white", size = 3.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Penguin Species by Above-Average Weight (Percent)",
    x = "Above Average Weight?",
    y = "Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### One Quantitative Predictor

-   Penguin has a billlength of 50 mm

We have to first find the mean and standard deviation for each species

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd = sd(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Let's plot this!

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 38.8, sd = 2.66), 
                aes(color = "Adelie")) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 48.8, sd = 3.34),
                aes(color = "Chinstrap")) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 47.5, sd = 3.08),
                aes(color = "Gentoo")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note on one naive bayes assumption - assuming normal distributions

-   The bill length distributions actually look like this

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We need to evaluate the likelihood of observing a 50mm-long bill among each of the three species

Adelie

```{r}
dnorm(50, mean = 38.8, sd = 2.66)
likelihood_adelie_50mm_bill <- 0.00002119955
```

Question - what is this value? Let's visualize

```{r}
adelie_penguins <- subset(penguins, species == "Adelie")

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of bill_length_mm for Adelie penguins
mean_bill<- mean(adelie_penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_bill <- sd(adelie_penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

# Value to highlight (50 mm)
highlight_value <- 50
highlight_density <- dnorm(highlight_value, mean = mean_bill, sd = sd_bill)

# Plot the normal distribution with a point for 50 mm and 1 standard deviation lines
ggplot(adelie_penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_density(color = "blue", size = 1) +  # Plot the density curve
  
  # Highlight the point for 50 mm
  geom_point(aes(x = highlight_value, y = highlight_density), 
             color = "red", size = 3) +  
  
  # Add a vertical dashed line for 50 mm
  geom_vline(xintercept = highlight_value, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +  
  
  # Add vertical lines for 1 standard deviation from the mean
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_bill + sd_bill, linetype = "dotted", color = "black") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_bill - sd_bill, linetype = "dotted", color = "black") + 
  
  # Add annotations for standard deviation lines
  annotate("text", x = mean_bill + sd_bill + 1, y = 0.01, 
           label = "+1 SD", color = "black", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = mean_bill - sd_bill - 1, y = 0.01, 
           label = "-1 SD", color = "black", hjust = 1) +
  
  # Add labels and title
  labs(title = "Normal Distribution of Bill Lengths for Adelie Penguins",
       subtitle = paste("Mean =", round(mean_bill, 2), "mm, SD =", round(sd_bill, 2), "mm"),
       x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Density") +
  
  # Add annotation for 150 mm
  annotate("text", x = highlight_value + 2, y = highlight_density, 
           label = paste0("50 mm\nDensity: ", round(highlight_density, 5)),
           hjust = 0, color = "red") +
  
  # Minimal theme for cleaner look
  theme_minimal()
```

Chinstrap

```{r}
dnorm(50, mean = 48.8, sd = 3.34)
likelihood_chinstrap_50mm_bill <- 0.1119782
```

Gentoo

```{r}
dnorm(50, mean = 47.5, sd = 3.08)
likelihood_gentoo_50mm_bill <- 0.09317395
```

Prior Probabilities for weighting

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species)
```

```{r}
prior_probability_adelie <- 0.44
prior_probability_chinstrap <- 0.2
prior_probability_gentoo <- 0.36
```

```{r}
(prior_probability_adelie * likelihood_adelie_50mm_bill) + (prior_probability_chinstrap * likelihood_chinstrap_50mm_bill) +
(prior_probability_gentoo* likelihood_gentoo_50mm_bill)
```

```{r}
species_bill_length_weighted_likelihood <- 0.05594759
```

P(Adelie \| 50mm bill length)

```{r}
(prior_probability_adelie * likelihood_adelie_50mm_bill) / species_bill_length_weighted_likelihood
```

P(Chinstrap \| 50mm bill length)

```{r}
(prior_probability_chinstrap * likelihood_chinstrap_50mm_bill) / species_bill_length_weighted_likelihood
```

P(Gentoo\| 50mm bill length)

```{r}
(prior_probability_gentoo * likelihood_gentoo_50mm_bill) / species_bill_length_weighted_likelihood
```

#### Two Predictors

Consider the information that our penguin has a bill length of X2=50mm *and* a flipper length of X3=195mm. Either one of these measurements alone might lead to a misclassification. Just as it’s tough to distinguish between the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins based on their bill lengths alone, it’s tough to distinguish between the Chinstrap and Adelie penguins based on their flipper lengths alone

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)
```

BUT the species are fairly distinguishable when we *combine* the information about bill and flipper lengths. Our penguin with a 50mm-long bill and 195mm-long flipper, represented at the intersection of the dashed lines in Figure [14.5](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-14#fig:ch14-bill-flipper), now lies squarely among the Chinstrap observations

```{r}
ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 195)
```

Likelihoods for flipper length

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Adelie

```{r}
dnorm(195, mean = 190, sd = 6.54)
likelihood_adelie_195_mm_flipper <- 0.04554175

```

Chinstrap

```{r}
dnorm(195, mean = 196, sd = 7.13)
likelihood_chinstrap_195_mm_flipper <- 0.05540502
```

Gentoo

```{r}
dnorm(195, mean = 217, sd = 6.48)
likelihood_gentoo_195_mm_flipper <- 0.0001933746
```

Calculating probabilities

```{r}
(likelihood_adelie_50mm_bill * likelihood_adelie_195_mm_flipper * prior_probability_adelie) +
(likelihood_chinstrap_50mm_bill * likelihood_chinstrap_195_mm_flipper * prior_probability_chinstrap) +
(likelihood_gentoo_50mm_bill * likelihood_gentoo_195_mm_flipper * prior_probability_gentoo) 

flipper_length_bill_length_species_weighted_likelihood <- 0.001247742
```

Probability Adelie

```{r}
(prior_probability_adelie * likelihood_adelie_195_mm_flipper * likelihood_adelie_50mm_bill) / flipper_length_bill_length_species_weighted_likelihood
```

Probability Chinstrap

```{r}
(prior_probability_chinstrap * likelihood_chinstrap_195_mm_flipper * likelihood_chinstrap_50mm_bill) / flipper_length_bill_length_species_weighted_likelihood
```

Probability Gentoo

```{r}
(prior_probability_gentoo * likelihood_gentoo_195_mm_flipper * likelihood_gentoo_50mm_bill) / flipper_length_bill_length_species_weighted_likelihood
```

That was a fair amount of math...

#### Naive Bayes Classification!

```{r}
naive_model <- naiveBayes(species ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm + above_average_weight, data = penguins)
```

Our penguin

```{r}
our_penguin <- data.frame(bill_length_mm = 50, flipper_length_mm = 195, above_average_weight = "no")
```

Ask our model to make a prediction of what species our penguin is

```{r}
predict(naive_model, newdata = our_penguin, type = "raw")
```

Test our model fro accuracy with confusion matrix

```{r}
penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(predicted_species = predict(naive_model, newdata = .))
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(species, predicted_species) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %>%
  adorn_ns
```

```{r}
naive_model
```

### Challenge

**Exercise 14.10** The `pulse_of_the_nation` data in the **bayesrules** package contains responses of 1000 adults to a wide-ranging survey. In one question, respondents were asked about their belief in `climate_change`, selecting from the following options: climate change is `Not Real at All`, `Real but not Caused by People`, or `Real and Caused by People`. In this open-ended exercise, complete a naive Bayesian analysis of a person’s belief in `climate_change`, selecting a variety of possible predictors that are of interest to you.

-   First, use the `naiveBayes()` function first and examine results

-   Then, show the math similar to how we did above to confirm your results

```{r}
data("pulse_of_the_nation")
```
